<h1>Summarize</h1>

Summarize is an iphone application integrated with Starling Bank API

The purpose of the app is to fetch bank account info such as balance, category wise spending, scheduled direct debits etc and summarise the content for the user. The concept is that at the endof every month, the account user would prefer a summary of their spendings and upcoming direct debits.
This way the users are up to date with their account.

For the app development, I used SwiftUI and Combine. I also made use of three services
- Starling Bank API - Fetch account info
- ChatGPT API - create a summary text using given information
- Twilio Voice API - The user can receive a call and an automated voice would speak the summary

There is lot of scope to improve such as 
- Setup Notification to provide account summary at the end of every month or preferred time
- Setup  call to provide the summary every month instead of notification or both

I believe this app would be very useful for lots of people. 

Thank you 

Happy Coding :)
